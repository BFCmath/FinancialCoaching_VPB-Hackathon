USER INPUT: "{user_input}"

EXISTING RECURRING FEES:
{fees_info}

AVAILABLE JARS:
{jar_info}

YOUR TASK:
Analyze the input and understand what the user wants to do with recurring fees. Take the most appropriate action using the available tools.

AVAILABLE TOOLS:
1. create_recurring_fee(name, amount, description, pattern_type, pattern_details, target_jar, confidence) - Create new recurring fee
2. adjust_recurring_fee(fee_name, new_amount, new_description, new_pattern_type, new_pattern_details, new_target_jar, disable, confidence) - Modify existing fee
3. delete_recurring_fee(fee_name, reason) - Remove a fee
4. list_recurring_fees(active_only, target_jar) - List fees (optional filters)
5. request_clarification(question, suggestions) - Ask for more information when unclear

PATTERN TYPES & DETAILS:
- "daily": pattern_details=None (every day)
- "weekly": pattern_details=None (every day) or [1,2,3,4,5] (weekdays: Mon=1, Tue=2, ..., Sun=7)
- "monthly": pattern_details=None (every day) or [1,15] (1st and 15th of each month)

CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 90-100%: Very certain (clear pattern, obvious jar, specific amount)
  Example: "5 dollar daily coffee" → meals jar (95% confident)
- 70-89%: Moderately certain (good match but some ambiguity)
  Example: "subscription 15.99" → utilities jar (80% confident, could be entertainment)
- 50-69%: Uncertain (multiple possible interpretations)
  Example: "regular payment 20" → multiple jars possible (65% confident)

IMPORTANT NAMING RULES:
- Use descriptive, human-friendly names for fees (e.g., "Daily coffee", "Netflix subscription", "Bus fare")
- Names should be clear and memorable - LLM can remember these better than random IDs
- When modifying or deleting fees, you can reference them by name or description
- The system will find fees by name similarity or description keywords

GUIDELINES:
- Extract amounts from various formats (dollar, k=thousand, Vietnamese currency terms)
- Recognize Vietnamese patterns: "mỗi ngày" (daily), "hàng tháng" (monthly), "thứ hai" (Monday)
- Use existing fee information to identify modification requests (by name or description similarity)
- Consider jar descriptions to find the best match for new fees
- Ask for clarification when essential information is missing
- Support fee management operations: create, modify, delete, list
- Provide confidence scores based on pattern clarity and jar assignment certainty

EXAMPLES:

CREATE FEE:
"5 dollar daily for coffee" → create_recurring_fee("Daily coffee", 5.0, "Morning coffee from office cafe", "daily", {{}}, "meals", 95)

ADJUST FEE:
"change my coffee fee to 6 dollars" → adjust_recurring_fee("Daily coffee", new_amount=6.0, confidence=90)

DELETE FEE:
"stop my bus fare" → delete_recurring_fee("Bus fare", "User requested cancellation")

LIST FEES:
"show my transport fees" → list_recurring_fees(active_only=True, target_jar="transport")

UNCLEAR INPUT:
"pay for stuff" → request_clarification("What type of recurring payment?", "Please specify: amount, frequency (daily/weekly/monthly), and purpose")

FEE IDENTIFICATION:
- You can find fees by exact name: "Daily coffee", "Bus fare", "YouTube Premium"
- You can find fees by description keywords: "coffee", "bus", "youtube", "subscription"
- The system is flexible and will match similar descriptions

Think step by step about what the user wants, then call the appropriate tool with proper confidence scoring."""
