# AI Assistant Guide - Knowledge Base Agent

## ü§ñ Quick Start for AI Assistants

This is a **Knowledge Base Agent** that answers questions about **financial concepts** and **app features** using intelligent ReAct framework with LangChain tool binding. The agent combines online search capabilities with hardcoded app documentation to provide comprehensive answers about personal finance topics and application functionality.

### Core Understanding
- **Financial knowledge assistant** - Answers questions about budgeting, investing, compound interest, etc.
- **App documentation expert** - Explains app features like jar system, budget suggestions, etc.
- **ReAct framework** - Uses Reason-Act-Observe cycle until complete answer is provided
- **3 specialized tools** - Online search, app documentation, and response formatting
- **LangChain integration** - Uses tool binding for intelligent tool selection and conversation management
- **Formatted responses** - Always provides structured, helpful answers via respond() tool
- **Single-pass processing** - Continues reasoning until final formatted answer is delivered

## üéØ Primary Use Cases

### 1. Financial Concept Explanation
Help users understand financial concepts and terminology:
- "What is compound interest?"
- "How does budgeting work?"
- "What are investment strategies?"
- "Explain emergency funds"
- "What's the difference between savings and checking accounts?"

### 2. App Feature Documentation
Explain how the personal finance app works:
- "How does the jar system work?"
- "Tell me about budget suggestions"
- "How does automatic categorization work?"
- "What are the main features of this app?"
- "How do I track subscriptions?"

### 3. Combined Knowledge Queries
Answer questions that require both financial knowledge and app context:
- "What is budgeting and how does this app help?"
- "Explain savings and how to track them in the app"
- "How can this app help me manage my finances better?"
- "What financial concepts should I know and how does the app support them?"

## üèóÔ∏è Agent Architecture

### **ReAct Framework Pattern:**
```
User Query ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Act (gather info) ‚Üí Observe ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Act (respond) ‚Üí Final Answer
```

### **Tool Selection Logic:**
```
Financial Question ‚Üí search_online() ‚Üí respond()
App Question ‚Üí get_application_information() ‚Üí respond()
Mixed Question ‚Üí search_online() + get_application_information() ‚Üí respond()
```

### **LangChain Tool Binding Implementation:**
```python
# All 3 tools bound to LLM for intelligent selection
KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS = [
    search_online,
    get_application_information,
    respond
]

llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS)

# ReAct loop continues until respond() is called
while iteration < max_iterations:
response = llm_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    if "respond" tool called:
        return final_answer
    else:
        continue_conversation()
```

### Tool Result Structure:
```python
TOOL_RESULT = {
    "data": {
        "query": str,               # Original search query
        "results": str,             # Search results or app info
        "source": str              # "online_search" or "app_documentation"
    },
    "description": str             # LLM-provided description of what was retrieved
}

FINAL_RESPONSE = {
    "data": {
        "final_answer": str,        # Complete formatted answer
        "response_type": "complete", # Indicates completion
        "source": "knowledge_assistant"
    },
    "description": str             # Brief description of the response
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Knowledge Retrieval Tools (3 Core Tools)

    enhanced_query = f"{query} financial definition guide explanation"
    
    try:
        search_results = search_tool.run(enhanced_query)
        return {
            "data": {
                "query": query,
                "results": search_results,
                "source": "online_search"
            },
            "description": description or f"online search for: {query}"
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "data": {
                "query": query,
                "results": f"Search error: {str(e)}",
                "source": "online_search"
            },
            "description": f"search error for: {query}"
        }
```

### 2. **`get_application_information(description: str = "")`**
**Purpose:** Get complete information about the personal finance app and all its features

**Parameters:**
- `description`: What app information you need (LLM-provided)

**Returns:** Dict with comprehensive app documentation

**Features Documented:**
- **Jar System**: Virtual budget jars for spending categories
- **Budget Suggestions**: Personalized budget recommendations
- **Auto Categorization**: Automatic transaction sorting
- **Transaction Search**: Advanced search with natural language

    "app_overview": {
        "name": "VPBank Personal Finance Assistant",
        "description": "Smart personal finance app for budgeting and goal achievement",
        "main_features": ["üè∫ Smart Budget Jars", "ü§ñ Auto Transaction Sorting", "üí° Budget Suggestions"]
    },
    "jar_system": {
        "overview": "Virtual budget jars for spending categories",
        "how_it_works": "Create jars, set budgets, transactions auto-sort into jars",
        "example": "Set $400 for groceries, see remaining balance after shopping"
    },
    # ... more features
}
```

### 3. **`respond(answer: str, description: str = "")`** 
**Purpose:** Provide the final formatted response to the user's question (MANDATORY - stops ReAct execution)

**Parameters:**
- `answer`: The complete, formatted answer to the user's question
- `description`: Brief description of what you're responding about

**Returns:** Dict with final response that ends the ReAct loop

**Critical Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ **MUST be called** to complete every query
- ‚úÖ **Complete answers** with proper formatting
- ‚úÖ **Clear explanations** with examples when helpful
- ‚úÖ **Structured information** that's easy to understand

**Example Usage:**
```python
respond(
    answer="Compound interest is the interest calculated on the initial principal and accumulated interest from previous periods. For example, if you invest $1000 at 5% annual compound interest, after one year you'd have $1050, and after two years you'd have $1102.50 because the second year's interest is calculated on $1050, not just the original $1000.",
    description="explaining compound interest with example"
)
```

## üß† ReAct Framework Flow

### **Conversation Pattern:**
```
1. User asks question
2. LLM analyzes question type (financial vs app vs mixed)
3. LLM calls appropriate information gathering tool(s)
4. LLM processes gathered information
5. LLM calls respond() with complete formatted answer
6. Agent returns final answer to user
```

### **Tool Selection Examples:**

**Financial Questions:**
- "What is compound interest?" ‚Üí `search_online("compound interest definition")` ‚Üí `respond("Compound interest is...")`
- "How does budgeting work?" ‚Üí `search_online("budgeting basics")` ‚Üí `respond("Budgeting is...")`

**App Questions:**
- "How does the jar system work?" ‚Üí `get_application_information("jar system info")` ‚Üí `respond("The jar system...")`
- "What features does this app have?" ‚Üí `get_application_information("app features")` ‚Üí `respond("This app provides...")`

**Mixed Questions:**
- "What is budgeting and how does this app help?" ‚Üí `search_online("budgeting definition")` ‚Üí `get_application_information("budget features")` ‚Üí `respond("Budgeting is... This app helps by...")`

## üö® Critical Requirements

### ‚úÖ **MUST DO:**
- **Always call respond()** - Every query must end with a formatted response
- **Provide complete answers** - Include definitions, examples, and context
- **Use clear language** - Explain concepts in simple, understandable terms
- **Include examples** - Concrete examples help understanding
- **Format responses well** - Use structure and organization
- **Combine information** - Use multiple tools when beneficial

### ‚ùå **NEVER DO:**
- **Return raw tool outputs** - Always format through respond()
- **Skip the respond() call** - This is mandatory for completion
- **Give incomplete answers** - Ensure answers are comprehensive
- **Provide financial advice** - Focus on education, not recommendations
- **Make assumptions** - Base answers on gathered information

## üéØ Success Criteria
