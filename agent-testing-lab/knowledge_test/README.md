# Knowledge Base Agent

A smart personal finance knowledge assistant that uses a ReAct (Reason-Act) framework with LangChain tool binding to answer questions about financial concepts and app features.

## 🧠 Overview

The Knowledge Base Agent helps users by:
- 📚 **Financial Knowledge**: Answering questions about financial concepts using online search (DuckDuckGo)
- 📱 **App Documentation**: Providing detailed information about the personal finance app features
- 🔄 **ReAct Framework**: Using structured reasoning loops with LangChain tool binding to provide comprehensive answers
- ✅ **Guaranteed Completion**: Always provides formatted final answers via mandatory `respond()` tool

## 🛠️ How It Works

The agent uses a **ReAct (Reason-Act-Observe) framework** with **LangChain tool binding**:

1. **THINK** - Analyzes what information is needed based on query type
2. **ACT** - Calls appropriate tools to gather information (search_online, get_application_information)
3. **OBSERVE** - Reviews the results and determines next steps
4. **THINK** - Decides if more information is needed or if ready to respond
5. **ACT** - Either gathers more data or calls `respond()` with formatted answer
6. **STOP** - Execution completes when `respond()` tool is called

### 🎯 **Key Innovation: LangChain Tool Binding**
```python
# Intelligent tool selection with conversation management
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS)

# Continues reasoning until respond() is called
while iteration < max_react_iterations:
    response = llm_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    if respond_tool_called:
        return final_formatted_answer
    else:
        continue_conversation_loop()
```

## ⚡ Features

### 🔧 Three Core Tools

1. **`search_online(query, description)`** - Searches for financial knowledge using DuckDuckGo with enhanced queries
2. **`get_application_information(description)`** - Returns complete app documentation and features
3. **`respond(answer, description)`** - **MANDATORY** - Provides final formatted answer and stops execution

### 💡 Smart Query Handling

- **Financial Questions**: "What is compound interest?" → `search_online()` → `respond()`
- **App Features**: "How does the jar system work?" → `get_application_information()` → `respond()`  
- **Mixed Questions**: "What is budgeting and how does this app help?" → Both tools → `respond()`

### 🎯 Example Queries

```
📚 Financial Knowledge:
• "What is compound interest?"
• "How does budgeting work?"
• "What are investment strategies?"
• "Explain emergency funds"

📱 App Features:
• "How does this app work?"
• "What is the jar system?"
• "Tell me about budget suggestions"
• "How does auto-categorization work?"

🔄 Mixed Questions:
• "What is budgeting and how does this app help?"
• "Explain savings and how to track them in the app"
• "How can this app help me manage my finances better?"
```

### 🏗️ **Technical Implementation**

**LangChain Tool Binding Pattern:**
```python
KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS = [search_online, get_application_information, respond]
llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(KNOWLEDGE_TOOLS)

# ReAct loop with guaranteed completion
while iteration < max_react_iterations:
    response = llm_with_tools.invoke(messages)
    tool_calls = response.tool_calls
    
    if any(call["name"] == "respond" for call in tool_calls):
        return extract_final_answer(tool_calls)
    
    # Process other tool calls and continue conversation
    messages.extend(process_tool_calls(tool_calls))
    iteration += 1
```

## 🎨 Example Interaction

```
User: "What is compound interest and how can this app help me with it?"

Agent ReAct Process:
1. THINK: Need both financial concept + app features
2. ACT: search_online("compound interest definition examples")
3. OBSERVE: Got comprehensive explanation with examples
4. THINK: Now need app-specific savings/investment features  
5. ACT: get_application_information("savings and budget features")
6. OBSERVE: Got jar system and budget suggestions info
7. THINK: Have complete information for comprehensive answer
8. ACT: respond("Compound interest is the interest calculated on...")
9. STOP: ✅ Complete formatted educational response delivered
```

## 🆘 Support & Debugging

### **Quick Troubleshooting:**
```bash
# Test everything
python test.py

# Validate configuration  
python config.py

# Enable detailed logging
# Set DEBUG_MODE=true in .env

# Check individual tools
python -c "from tools import search_online; print(search_online('test', 'debug'))"
```

### **Common Issues:**
- **Missing API key**: Check `GOOGLE_API_KEY` in `.env`
- **Tool not responding**: Verify internet connection for search
