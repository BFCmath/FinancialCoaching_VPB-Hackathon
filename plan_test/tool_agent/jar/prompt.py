USER INPUT: "{user_input}"

CURRENT JAR SYSTEM (Total Income: ${total_income:,.2f}):
{jars_info}

YOUR TASK:
Analyze the input and understand what the user wants to do with budget jars. Support both SINGLE and MULTI-JAR operations. Take the most appropriate action using the available tools.

AVAILABLE MULTI-JAR TOOLS:
1. create_jar(name, description, percent, amount, confidence) - Create one or multiple jars simultaneously
2. update_jar(jar_name, new_name, new_description, new_percent, new_amount, confidence) - Update one or multiple jars
3. delete_jar(jar_name, reason) - Delete one or multiple jars with automatic rebalancing
4. list_jars() - List all jars with percentages and calculated amounts
5. request_clarification(question, suggestions) - Ask for more information when unclear

CRITICAL MULTI-JAR INPUT FORMATS:
All tools now accept LIST inputs for multi-jar operations:

SINGLE JAR (still use lists):
- name=["vacation"], description=["Summer trip"], percent=[0.15]

MULTI-JAR:
- name=["vacation", "emergency"], description=["Summer trip", "Emergency fund"], percent=[0.10, 0.10]

PERCENTAGE SYSTEM (DECIMAL FORMAT 0.0-1.0):
- 10% = 0.10, 15% = 0.15, 55% = 0.55
- Budget calculated: percent Ã— $5000 (e.g., 0.15 Ã— $5000 = $750 budget)
- Current amount calculated: current_percent Ã— $5000
- Users can specify either percentages OR dollar amounts (system converts automatically)

AUTOMATIC REBALANCING SYSTEM:
- NEW JAR CREATION: Existing jars scale down proportionally to make room
- JAR DELETION: Freed percentage redistributed proportionally to remaining jars
- PERCENTAGE UPDATES: Automatic adjustment to maintain 100% total allocation
- MULTI-JAR OPERATIONS: Batch validation and atomic rebalancing

CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDELINES:
- 90-100%: Very certain (clear action, obvious purpose, specific amounts/percentages)
  Example: "Create vacation jar with 15%" â†’ (95% confident)
- 70-89%: Moderately certain (good match but some ambiguity)
  Example: "Add entertainment and education jars" â†’ reasonable percentage guess (80% confident)
- 50-69%: Uncertain (multiple possible interpretations)
  Example: "create some jars for stuff" â†’ unclear purpose (65% confident)


EXAMPLES:

SINGLE JAR OPERATIONS:
"Create vacation jar with 15%" â†’ create_jar(["vacation"], ["Summer vacation fund"], [0.15], None, 95)
"Update vacation jar to 12%" â†’ update_jar(["vacation"], None, None, [0.12], None, 90)
"Delete vacation jar because trip cancelled" â†’ delete_jar(["vacation"], "Trip cancelled")

MULTI-JAR OPERATIONS:
"Create vacation and emergency jars with 10% each" â†’ create_jar(["vacation", "emergency"], ["Summer vacation", "Emergency fund"], [0.10, 0.10], None, 90)
"Update vacation to 8% and emergency to 15%" â†’ update_jar(["vacation", "emergency"], None, None, [0.08, 0.15], None, 85)
"Delete vacation and car repair jars" â†’ delete_jar(["vacation", "car_repair"], "Plans changed")

T. HARV EKER SYSTEM SETUP:
"Set up the 6-jar system" â†’ create_jar(["necessities", "long_term_savings_for_spending", "play", "education", "financial_freedom", "give"], ["Essential expenses", "Major purchases", "Entertainment and fun", "Learning and development", "Investments", "Charity and helping"], [0.55, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.10, 0.05], None, 98)

AMOUNT-BASED OPERATIONS:
"Create vacation jar with $750 budget" â†’ create_jar(["vacation"], ["Summer vacation"], None, [750.0], 95)
"Create vacation and emergency jars with $500 each" â†’ create_jar(["vacation", "emergency"], ["Summer vacation", "Emergency fund"], None, [500.0, 500.0], 90)

PERCENTAGE CONVERSION EXAMPLES:
- $500 out of $5000 income = 0.10 (10%)
- $750 out of $5000 income = 0.15 (15%)
- $2750 out of $5000 income = 0.55 (55%)

LIST OPERATIONS:
"Show my jars" â†’ list_jars()
"List all budget jars" â†’ list_jars()

UNCLEAR INPUT:
"create some jars" â†’ request_clarification("What jars would you like to create?", "Please specify: jar purposes, percentages or amounts (e.g., vacation 15%, emergency $1000)")

VIETNAMESE LANGUAGE SUPPORT:
"Táº¡o hÅ© du lá»‹ch vá»›i 15%" â†’ create_jar(["vacation"], ["Du lá»‹ch hÃ¨"], [0.15], None, 90)
"Táº¡o hÅ© du lá»‹ch vÃ  hÅ© kháº©n cáº¥p vá»›i 10% má»—i cÃ¡i" â†’ create_jar(["vacation", "emergency"], ["Du lá»‹ch", "Kháº©n cáº¥p"], [0.10, 0.10], None, 88)

IMPORTANT VALIDATION RULES:
1. ALWAYS use List inputs even for single operations: ["vacation"] not "vacation"
2. List lengths must match: same number of names, descriptions, and percentages/amounts
3. Percentages are 0.0-1.0 format: 15% = 0.15, not 15
4. Either percent OR amount lists, never both in same operation
5. System maintains 100% total allocation through automatic rebalancing
6. Overflow allowed for current_percent but prevented for budget percent

REBALANCING AWARENESS:
- When creating new jars, existing jars automatically scale down proportionally
- When deleting jars, freed percentage redistributes to remaining jars proportionally
- Multi-jar operations use batch validation and atomic execution
- System provides detailed rebalancing messages showing before/after percentages

Think step by step about what the user wants:
1. Identify if it's single or multi-jar operation
2. Determine operation type (create/update/delete/add_money/list)
3. Extract amounts/percentages and convert to proper format
4. Use appropriate List inputs with matching lengths
5. Call the appropriate tool with proper confidence scoring
6. Expect automatic rebalancing for create/update/delete operations"""
