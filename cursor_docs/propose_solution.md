This is an excellent and very common problem in multi-agent systems. You've perfectly identified a key failure point: a stateless orchestrator losing the context of a stateful, deep conversation.

The core issue is that the **Orchestrator's job is to find the right *starting point* for a task**, while a **specialist agent's job is to *complete* that task**, even if it takes multiple steps. When the user responds to a specialist agent's question, the context belongs to that agent, not the orchestrator.

Here is a general and effective solution: **Implement an "Active Agent Context" or "Conversation Lock".**

This pattern temporarily delegates routing control from the Orchestrator to the specialist agent that initiated the deep conversation.

---

### The Proposed Solution: Active Agent Context

The principle is simple: when a complex agent like the `Budget Advisor` needs to ask the user a follow-up question, it also tells the system, **"I'm not done yet. Route the user's *next* response directly back to me."**

#### How It Works:

**1. Modify the Agent's Response Protocol**

When a ReAct-based agent like `Budget Advisor` or `Fee Manager` uses its `respond()` tool, it can now include an optional parameter.

Let's modify the `respond` tool for these agents:
`respond(summary, advice, question_ask_user, **requires_follow_up=False**)`

*   If `requires_follow_up` is `True`, it means the agent is in the middle of a process and is expecting a direct answer.
*   If `requires_follow_up` is `False` (or omitted), it means the agent has finished its task.

**2. Introduce a "State Manager" in Your Main Loop**

Your main application loop (the code that gets user input and calls the orchestrator) will now have a simple state variable.

```python
# In your main application logic
active_agent_context = None 
```

This variable will store the name of the agent that has the "lock" on the conversation (e.g., `'budget_advisor'`).

**3. Update the Main Control Flow**

Your application's top-level logic will change from this:
`User Input -> Orchestrator -> Route to Agent`

To this:

```
# New Control Flow
1. Get User Input.

2. CHECK CONTEXT: Is `active_agent_context` set to something (e.g., 'budget_advisor')?

   a. IF YES:
      - Bypass the Orchestrator entirely.
      - Route the user's input directly to the agent stored in `active_agent_context`.
      - The agent processes the input. Check its response:
         - If the agent responds with `requires_follow_up=True`, keep the `active_agent_context` locked.
         - If the agent responds with `requires_follow_up=False`, the task is complete. Set `active_agent_context = None`. The lock is released.

   b. IF NO:
      - The conversation is open. Proceed as normal.
      - Send the user input to the Orchestrator.
      - The Orchestrator routes to the chosen agent.
      - After the agent runs, check its response:
         - If it responds with `requires_follow_up=True`, set `active_agent_context = [agent_name]`. The lock is now engaged.
```

#### Example Walkthrough (Your Japan Trip Scenario)

Let's trace your example with this new logic.

**Turn 1:**
*   **User:** "I want to go to japan in the next 3 month"
*   **`active_agent_context`:** `None`.
*   **Action:** Route to **Orchestrator**.
*   **Orchestrator Output:** `route_to_budget_advisor`.
*   **Budget Advisor Action:** Runs its ReAct loop, determines it needs more info.
*   **Budget Advisor Response Tool Call:** `respond(question_ask_user="Can you please detail how much money for the trip?", requires_follow_up=True)`
*   **System Action:**
    1.  Show the question to the user.
    2.  Set `active_agent_context = 'budget_advisor'`. **The lock is engaged.**

**Turn 2:**
*   **User:** "I think its about 10.000.000 vnÄ‘"
*   **`active_agent_context`:** `'budget_advisor'`.
*   **Action:** **Bypass the Orchestrator**. Route input directly to **Budget Advisor**.
*   **Budget Advisor Action:** Takes the amount, continues its planning logic.
*   **Budget Advisor Response Tool Call:** `respond(question_ask_user="Do you want to create a new jar... or adjust saving jar...?", requires_follow_up=True)`
*   **System Action:**
    1.  Show the question to the user.
    2.  `active_agent_context` remains `'budget_advisor'`. **The lock is maintained.**

**Turn 3 (The "Panic" Point):**
*   **User:** "I want to create new jar!"
*   **`active_agent_context`:** `'budget_advisor'`.
*   **Action:** **Bypass the Orchestrator**. Route input directly to **Budget Advisor**.
*   **Budget Advisor Action:**
    *   **No panic!** The `Budget Advisor` receives "I want to create new jar!" *in the context of its ongoing planning session*.
    *   Its internal prompt/logic knows this means "as part of the Japan trip plan I am currently building".
    *   It now formulates the final plan.
*   **Budget Advisor Response Tool Call:** `respond(summary="OK, I've created a new plan 'Japan Trip' with a new dedicated jar...", requires_follow_up=False)`
*   **System Action:**
    1.  Show the summary to the user.
    2.  Set `active_agent_context = None`. **The lock is released.** The conversation is now open for the Orchestrator again.

#### The "Escape Hatch"

What if the user wants to break the lock?
> **Budget Advisor:** Do you want to create a new jar...?
> **User:** Actually, nevermind. Can you just tell me what compound interest is?

The `Budget Advisor`'s own prompt must be robust enough to handle this. Its instructions should include: "If the user changes the subject or cancels the request, end your task and signal that you are finished." In this case, it would call `respond(summary="Okay, cancelling the plan creation.", requires_follow_up=False)`, which would release the lock. The system would then route the user's *next* message ("Can you just tell me what compound interest is?") to the Orchestrator, which would correctly send it to the `Knowledge Base`.

### Summary of Benefits

1.  **General & Scalable:** This pattern works for any agent that needs to have a multi-step conversation, not just the `Budget Advisor`.
2.  **Context Preservation:** It correctly keeps the conversational context with the agent that owns the task.
3.  **Reduces Orchestrator Burden:** The Orchestrator doesn't need impossibly complex prompts to understand the nuances of every possible conversation. It just needs to be a good initial router.
4.  **Natural User Experience:** The user isn't aware of the "lock". The conversation just flows naturally because the system correctly anticipates who should be listening.
5.  **Maintains Agent Intelligence:** The decision to maintain or release the lock is made by the specialist LLM agent, which has the most context about whether its task is complete.
