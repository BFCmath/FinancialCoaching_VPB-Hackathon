Confidence Service - Complete Implementation from Lab
=====================================================

This module implements the confidence handling service from the lab,
including all functions from utils.py and service.py related to confidence:
- format_confidence_response, request_clarification, determine_confidence_level
- should_ask_for_confirmation, generate_confidence_explanation, validate_user_intent, suggest_alternatives
No db operations, so all sync.
